PTScreenOff 
===========
This is a plugin for the PowerToggles to simulate the power button click to turn off
the screen. It will not lock the device like the lock widget. It works better with the
smart lock on Android 5.0+ because it will not lock the device when the smart lock is
in use.

This app requires root to send the power button event.
